    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>I am a dedicated teacher with a passion for growth and innovation in education. Challenges excite me, especially projects and goal-oriented activities that push me to expand my skills. My commitment to continuous learning extends beyond the classroom, as I actively seek opportunities to develop professionally. 
    I'm currently exploring avenues beyond traditional teaching roles, not just for personal growth, but to discover innovative approaches that could benefit the future of education in South Africa. My aim is to be a change-maker in our educational landscape, bringing fresh ideas and methodologies to enhance learning experiences across the country.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ </p>
