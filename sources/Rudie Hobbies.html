<h1>My hobbies</h1>

<ol>
    <h2><li>Sport</li></h2>
    <p>Golf, hockey and squash are my favourite to play while I am an avid Manchester United supporter and the days when the Springboks play are my favourite</p>
    <h2><li>Cooking</li></h2>
    <p>Braai takes preference but I do not mind spending time in the kitchen and testing Youtube recipes.</p>
    <h2><li>Brewing beer</li></h2>
    <p>Something I wish I could do more. I am still a rookie but love the learning and improving phase. </p>
